# CopyExtension
A windows shell extension to allow checking copied files and add more missing features

## Features
- Copy or move with 100% sureness the files are identical on disk (no cache and 100% bitwise compared)
- Copy with native speeds or better (double buffer for extra performance)
- Nuke empty files and folders
- Create hardlinks
- Fast and simple (and yet familiar) UI

## Screenshots
To Do

## Installation
- Find a release zip on github
- Unzip to any permanent folder (do not move the files afterwards)
- Run "install.bat" as admin (no reboot needed, uninstall.bat for uninstallation, this will restart explorer)

## Contact and support
I only provide limited support (it should work as-is)
